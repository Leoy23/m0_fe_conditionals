# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?

I honestly am having a lot of trouble connecting the dots and I guess thinking less about the process in a less complex way. I feel that the understanding of the basics is there, but I am consistently missing pieces I feel that I should already know.

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?

I think I feel the same way in regards to the logical operators. Things are just not sticking the way I'd like them to. But the progress is slow and I am okay with that.

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?

I am struggling with if statements but they make a lot of sense. I understand how to include more information with else if and else functions and I understand the ordering of the if statements. I think when things start to get more complex, the knowledge I need is lacking.

1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?

I would say a good 4+ hours. My team and I struggled together but it was a lot of information to get through, retain and immediately put to practice.

1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

I need to do more in depth learning when it comes to if statements and conditionals in general. I have to learn how to infer what I might need to use when dealing with different variables and trying to put them into statements that make sense.

1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

I just want to know how if statements work, when to use arrays within if statements if we are referring back to information or adding additional information for a specific topic. I will continue to advocate for myself and ask classmates, those who've had programming experience before and utilize google for often.
